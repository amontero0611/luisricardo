IBM Watson IoT full prototype.
Included in this project:

- The sketchup model (SKP file) for building a 3d-printed robot.
- The Arduino and ESP8266 code.
- The source code for a mobile app (.AIA) you can upload to MIT APP INVENTOR 2 for updating or customizing. 
  This app is for controlling the robot.
- A web page for controlling the robot. This web page should be deployed on a web server.
- A nodeRED flow for brokering messages between the control page or control app and the robot. This nodeRED flow 
needs to be deployed on an IBM BLUEMIX environment for exploiting the following services: Watson IoT, Cloudant, Twilio, and 
Twitter integration.
